After each policy execution, the remaining calls allowed in the time period are stored in the variable remainingCallsPerIP.\n<policies>\n<inbound>\n<base />\n<rate-limit-by-key calls=\"10\"\nrenewal-period=\"60\"\nincrement-condition=\"@(context.Response.StatusCode == 200)\"\ncounter-key=\"@(context.Request.IpAddress)\"\nremaining-calls-variable-name=\"remainingCallsPerIP\"/>\n</inbound>\n<outbound>\n<base />\n</outbound>\n</policies>\nNote: The rate-limit-by-key policy prevents API usage spikes on a per key basis by limiting the call rate to a specified number per a specified time period. The key can have an arbitrary string value and is typically provided using a policy expression. Optional increment condition can be added to specify which requests should be counted towards the limit. When this call rate is exceeded, the caller receives a 429 Too Many Requests response status code.\nIncorrect Answers:\nA: With renewal-period=\"30\" 200 calls/minute would be allowed.\nB: This would increase the calls/minute limit to 1000.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-access-restriction-policies",

    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Standard table with User or Team ownership\n\nTable ownership -\nThere are two different types of standard and custom table ownership. When you create a custom table the ownership options are User or team or Organization owned. Once a table is created, the ownership type can't be changed.\nOrganization - Data belongs to the organization. Access to the data is controlled at the organization level.\nUser or team - Data belongs to a user or a team. Actions that can be performed on these rows can be controlled on a user level.\nNote: Tables appear in Power Apps as one of three different types, which indicate how the table came into the environment, whether the table is managed or unmanaged, and whether it can be customized.\n* Standard: Several standard tables, also known as out-of-box tables, are included with a Power Platform environment, that includes Microsoft Dataverse.\nAccount, business unit, contact, task, and user tables are examples of standard tables in Dataverse. Most of the standard tables included with Dataverse can be customized. Tables that are imported as part of a managed solution and set as customizable also appear as standard tables. Any user with appropriate privileges can customize these tables where the table property has customizable set to true.\n* Managed: Are tables that aren't customizable and have been imported into the environment as part of a managed solution.\n* Custom: Custom tables are unmanaged tables that are either imported from an unmanaged solution or are new tables created directly in the environment. Any user with appropriate privileges can fully customize these tables.\nBox 2: Activity table with User or Team ownership\n\nActivity tables -\nAn activity can be thought of as any action for which an entry can be made on a calendar. An activity has time dimensions (start time, stop time, due date, and duration) that help determine when the action occurred or will occur. Activities also contain data that helps determine what action the activity represents, for example, subject and description. An activity can be opened, canceled, or completed. The completed status of an activity will have several sub-status values associated with it to clarify the way that the activity was completed.\nActivity tables are a special kind of table that can only be owned by a user or team, but can't be owned by an organization. When you create a table, you can specify it as a standard or activity table.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities",

Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nProseware, Inc. is an industry leading software company with several thousand employees. The company has had some trouble recruiting talented employees. Top-level candidates interview with the company but go on to work for competitors.\n\nFeedback from candidates show that some offers were not accepted because the interview scheduling process was unpleasant. The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nThe recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.\n\nRecruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.\n\nThe recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.\n\nThe company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:\n\n• JobPosting\n- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser\n• Contact (Job Applicant)\n- Contact identifier\n- First name\n- Last name\n- Time-Zone Offset\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)\n• Application proapplication\n- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- pro_recruiterassignedid\n• Interview\n- Application - lookup to Application\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value\n• Referral\n- Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n• SystemUser\n- Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Time-Zone Offset\n• Recruiter\n- Recruiter identifier\n- Recruiter name\n\n\nApplications -\nThere may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.\n\n\nInterviews -\nEach interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.\n\nThe interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.\n\nRequirements. Interview Scheduling\n\nThe system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.\n\n• The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.\n• The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.\n• You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.\n\nYou must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate’s local time.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Tracking\n\nYou must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring. You must assign each individual a score based on their past interactions.\n\n• You must be able to determine the following information about a candidate:\n- The number of interviews in the past two years and whether team members provided recommendations\n- The number of hiring manager referrals and employee referrals in the past two years\n- Whether the individual has any of the 12 designations or certifications that the company considers significant\n• Only a single referral can be made per job application. The system must be able to support multiple referrals for a candidate.\n• The system must track referrals even if an application is not completed.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Scoring\n\nThe automated process must run weekly to assess all candidates. The process must also run automatically when historical information is updated. You must be able to perform scoring by selecting a command button on the contact form.\n\n• This new command button must only be visible to employees who belong to a security role assigned named Recruiter. The command button must not be visible to anyone unless the contact form is in Update mode.\n• A person of interest is defined as having a score of 15 or more based on the following historical information criteria:\n- Each interview with a recommendation adds two to the score.\n- Each interview without a recommendation subtracts two from the score.\n- Each employee or manager referral adds one to the score.\n- Each designation or certification adds one to the score.\n• All scoring elements must be recalculated when changes occur.

The company has had some trouble recruiting talented employees. Top-level candidates interview with the company but go on to work for competitors.\n\nFeedback from candidates show that some offers were not accepted because the interview scheduling process was unpleasant. The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nThe recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.\n\nRecruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.\n\nThe recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.\n\nThe company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:\n\n• JobPosting\n- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser\n• Contact (Job Applicant)\n- Contact identifier\n- First name\n- Last name\n- Time-Zone Offset\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)\n• Application proapplication\n- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- pro_recruiterassignedid\n• Interview\n- Application - lookup to Application\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value\n• Referral\n- Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n• SystemUser\n- Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Time-Zone Offset\n• Recruiter\n- Recruiter identifier\n- Recruiter name\n\n\nApplications -\nThere may be multiple applications associated with each job posting.

To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment -\n\n\nEnvironment -\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData -\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API -\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nCustom connector -\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess -\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to determine which component to add to the solution to resolve the account records import error.\n\nWhich component should you add?",

    "answerDescription": "Step 1: Register the application in Azure AD with appropriate permissions.\nApp registration in Azure Active Directory is typically done by ISVs who want to develop external client applications to read and write data in Dataverse.\nRegistering an app in Azure Active Directory provides you with Application ID and Redirect URI values that ISVs can use in their client application's authentication code.\nStep 2: Use the Azure AD application id and secret as credentials in the application.\n\nAdd credentials -\nCredentials are used by confidential client applications that access a web API. Examples of confidential clients are web apps, other web APIs, or service-type and daemon-type applications. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime.\nYou can add both certificates and client secrets (a string) as credentials to your confidential client app registration.\nStep 3: Create the application user in Dataverse using the Application User form.\nApp registration can also be done by an application developer or individual user who is building a client application to connect to and read/write data in Dataverse.\nUse the Application ID and Redirect URI values from your registered app in your client application's authentication code to be able to connect to Dataverse environment from your client application, and perform the required operations. Note that if the app is registered in the same tenant as your Dataverse environment, you won't be presented with a consent form when connecting from your client application to your Dataverse environment.\nNote: When end users use the ISV's application for the first time to connect to their Dataverse environment by providing their Dataverse credentials, a consent form is presented to the end user. After consenting to use their Dataverse account with the ISV's application, end users can connect to Dataverse environment from external application. The consent form is not displayed again to other users after the first user who has already consented to use the ISV's app. Apps registered in Azure Active Directory are multi-tenant, which implies that other Dataverse users from other tenant can connect to their environment using the ISV's app.\nStep 4: Assign a security role to the application user in Dataverse\nGrant access to users that already have a Dynamics 365 license\nAny user who already has a license for any model-driven app in Dynamics 365 also will be able to access Dynamics 365 Marketing without requiring any additional licenses. All you need to do is assign them the security roles and privileges required to access the Marketing features they need.\nIncorrect:\n* Grant the Dataverse application user the Access Dynamics 365 as organization users permission in Azure AD.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/walkthrough-register-app-azure-active-directory https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/marketing/admin-users-licenses-roles",

    "question": "Case study -\n\nThis is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on this exam in the time provided.\n\nTo answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is independent of the other questions in this case study.\n\nAt the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\n\nTo start the case study -\nTo display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is identical to the information displayed on the subsequent tabs. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nNorthwind Traders uses Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales to manage its sales process. To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment -\n\n\nEnvironment -\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData -\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API -\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nCustom connector -\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess -\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to choose a technology to access the Web API.\n\nWhich technology should you select?",

      "B": "Plug-in that contacts the Web API",

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground\n-\n\nProseware, Inc. is an industry leading software company with several thousand employees. The company has had some trouble recruiting talented employees. Top-level candidates interview with the company but go on to work for competitors.\n\nFeedback from candidates show that some offers were not accepted because the interview scheduling process was unpleasant. The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.\n\n\nCurrent Environment\n-\n\nThe recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.\n\nRecruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.\n\nThe recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.\n\nThe company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:\n\n• JobPosting\n- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser\n• Contact (Job Applicant)\n- Contact identifier\n- First name\n- Last name\n- Time-Zone Offset\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)\n• Application proapplication\n- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- pro_recruiterassignedid\n• Interview\n- Application - lookup to Application\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value\n• Referral\n- Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n• SystemUser\n- Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Time-Zone Offset\n• Recruiter\n- Recruiter identifier\n- Recruiter name\n\n\nApplications\n-\nThere may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.\n\n\nInterviews\n-\nEach interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.\n\nThe interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.\n\nRequirements. Interview Scheduling\n\nThe system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.\n\n• The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.\n• The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.\n• You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.\n\nYou must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate’s local time.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Tracking\n\nYou must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring.

To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment -\n\n\nEnvironment -\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData -\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API -\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nCustom connector -\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess -\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues -\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to configure the row filter on the Dataverse trigger.\n\nWhich filter should you use?",

    "answerDescription": "Box 1: Security roles -\nA security role defines how different users, such as salespeople, access different types of records. To control access to data, you can modify existing security roles, create new security roles, or change which security roles are assigned to each user. Each user can have multiple security roles.\nSecurity role privileges are cumulative: having more than one security role gives a user every privilege available in every role.\nEach security role consists of record-level privileges and task-based privileges.\n\nBox 2: OAuth -\nOauth 2.0 is the most frequently used type, which uses the Oauth 2 authentication framework to authenticate with the service. Before using this authentication type, you'll need to register your application with the service so that it can receive access tokens for the users.\nFor example, Register the application in Azure AD shows how to register an application with the Azure Active Directory service.\nDuring the connection creation process, the user will be asked to enter the credentials for login to the service. These credentials will be used by the application to get an authorization token. For every request, this authorization token will be sent to your service through the Authorization header.\n\nBox 3: Basic Authentication -\nBasic Authentication is the simplest type of authentication, where the user just has to provide the username and password to create the connection.\nNote: Before using any connector in Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Power Automate, or Microsoft Power Apps, the user needs to create a connection by authenticating to the backend service.\n\nAuthentication types -\nThe different types of authentication that are currently supported are:\n\nNo authentication -\n\nBasic authentication -\n\nApi Key based authentication -\n\nOauth 2.0 -\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/admin/security-roles-privileges https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/connection-parameters",

After you begin a new section, you cannot return to this section.\n\n\nTo start the case study -\nTo display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem statements. When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question.\n\n\nBackground -\n\nProseware, Inc. is an industry leading software company with several thousand employees. The company has had some trouble recruiting talented employees. Top-level candidates interview with the company but go on to work for competitors.\n\nFeedback from candidates show that some offers were not accepted because the interview scheduling process was unpleasant. The company does not have a system to keep track of the candidates that were not selected.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\nThe recruiting process starts when an individual applies for a position on the company website. The individual may have found the position on their own, they may have been officially referred by an employee, or in some cases were contacted directly by a hiring manager and encouraged to apply.\n\nRecruiters schedule an interview with a hiring manager and interviews with two senior team members. Each interview results in feedback about the candidate and a recommendation whether to hire or not.\n\nThe recruiting team manages all information by using a model-driven application.\n\nThe company has the following Microsoft Dataverse tables and columns:\n\n• JobPosting\n- Hiring Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Recruiter Assigned - lookup to SystemUser\n• Contact (Job Applicant)\n- Contact identifier\n- First name\n- Last name\n- Time-Zone Offset\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No (default)\n• Application proapplication\n- Contact identifier, Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- pro_recruiterassignedid\n• Interview\n- Application - lookup to Application\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n- Recommend - Choice (Yes (0), No (1), and null (default) are the available values)\n- Person of Interest - Yes/No, No is the default value\n• Referral\n- Contact - lookup to Contact\n- Referrer - lookup to SystemUser\n- Job Posting - lookup to JobPosting\n• SystemUser\n- Manager - lookup to SystemUser\n- Time-Zone Offset\n• Recruiter\n- Recruiter identifier\n- Recruiter name\n\n\nApplications -\nThere may be multiple applications associated with each job posting. Applications are linked to an employee record if an employee referred the applicant for a position. The same individual can be an applicant for multiple job postings.\n\n\nInterviews -\nEach interview is performed by an employee and is related to a single application.\n\nThe interview scheduling process may force potential candidates to accept interviews at unusual times with the senior team members due to time-zone differences.\n\nRequirements. Interview Scheduling\n\nThe system must provide recruiters with a list of team members and their time-zone information. You must create a Microsoft Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) control for the Job Application form to display a list of senior team members who report directly to a hiring manager.\n\n• The control must display the current time in each team member's local time.\n• The control must be bound so that it minimizes the amount of code that must be written.\n• You must display the list of team members and sort the list to show team members who reside in time zones closest to the applicant's time zone first.\n\nYou must develop a second PCF control that displays the time-zone name and current time on the Job Application form. You must display the data in the candidate’s local time.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Tracking\n\nYou must create a process to identify individuals as a person of interest that the company should consider hiring. You must assign each individual a score based on their past interactions.\n\n• You must be able to determine the following information about a candidate:\n- The number of interviews in the past two years and whether team members provided recommendations\n- The number of hiring manager referrals and employee referrals in the past two years\n- Whether the individual has any of the 12 designations or certifications that the company considers significant\n• Only a single referral can be made per job application. The system must be able to support multiple referrals for a candidate.\n• The system must track referrals even if an application is not completed.\n\nRequirements. Historical Information Scoring\n\nThe automated process must run weekly to assess all candidates. The process must also run automatically when historical information is updated. You must be able to perform scoring by selecting a command button on the contact form.\n\n• This new command button must only be visible to employees who belong to a security role assigned named Recruiter. The command button must not be visible to anyone unless the contact form is in Update mode.\n• A person of interest is defined as having a score of 15 or more based on the following historical information criteria:\n- Each interview with a recommendation adds two to the score.\n- Each interview without a recommendation subtracts two from the score.\n- Each employee or manager referral adds one to the score.\n- Each designation or certification adds one to the score.\n• All scoring elements must be recalculated when changes occur. You must assign the score to the Person of interest field.\n• Values representing totals or scores must be stored in their own numeric fields.\n• Plug-ins must be used to keep the Person of Interest field on active interview records associated with the Contact.\n• Plug-ins registered on the update of the Person of interest field must send an email notification when the candidate named in the email is a person of interest. Recruiters must receive the message when the field is updated on the Contact record.\n• Interviewers must get an email notification when the Person of Interest field on the interview record is successfully updated.\n\n\nRequirements.

To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nEnvironment\n-\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData\n-\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API\n-\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nCustom connector\n-\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess\n-\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to configure security for the Azure Function and custom connector.\n\nWhich security tool should you configure for each item?

To better understand its customers, Northwind Traders invests in a team of researchers who gather data from multiple sources. The company stores the data it collects in a Microsoft Azure SQL Database. The company plans to use the data to enrich account records and make the sales team more effective.\n\n\nCurrent environment\n-\n\n\nEnvironment\n-\n\n• The company has three Microsoft Power Platform environments with Dynamics 365 Sales installed. The environments are named development, test, and production.\n• Each environment has an application user that can be used for integrations.\n• The company must use solutions to perform all customization and configuration deployment.\n\n\nData\n-\n\n• Researchers are responsible for creating account records.\n• Researchers have permissions on the Account table to create records, read all records, and update records they own.\n• A synchronous plug-in runs when an account record is created and could reassign the record to a different user.\n• Users must access data as themselves to enforce security and audit changes.\n• A column named new_dataid is added to the Account table. The column uniquely identifies which data it should receive.\n• Researchers have researched only the top 20 percent of account records.\n\n\nWeb API\n-\n\n• The company creates an Azure Function to run a RESTful .NET Web API.\n• Data can be retrieved by placing a GET request to the URL https://dataservice-[ENVIRONMENTNAME].azurewebsites.net/enrich/[DATAID].\n• [ENVIRONMENTNAME] is the name of the Microsoft Power Platform environment that requests the data.\n• [DATAID] is the new_dataid column in the Account table.\n• The Web API response will return a 200 response plus data if the DataId is found. Otherwise, a 404 response is returned.\n• Developers plan to create a custom connector from the Web API to make it accessible from Microsoft Power Platform.\n\n\nRequirements\n-\n\n\nCustom connector\n-\n\n• The Web API definition used to create the custom connector must be generated based on a low-code technology.\n• The URL used by the custom connector must incorporate the current environment name without hardcoding values.\n• Errors generated by the custom connector must not cause downstream processes to fail.\n• Text descriptions and field placeholder text that describe the use of the custom connector must appear for non-developers.\n\n\nProcess\n-\n\n• All account records must be updated with data from the Web API once automatically.\n• Only account records that contain a DataId should be updated by the Web API.\n• Researchers must create Power Automate flows to specify data analysis priority.\n• The researchers require a process that repurposes a set of identical steps of parameterized Microsoft Dataverse queries from a Power Automate flow for use in other flows that have different parameters. The researchers want to avoid recreating the steps manually each time they create a flow to save time and avoid errors.\n\n\nIssues\n-\n\n• A tester attempts to connect to the production instance of the Web API with a DataId that should return data. The tester receives an error stating that the remote name could not be resolved.\n• A missing component causes an error to occur when importing the solution that contains the Power Automate flow to update account records in a test environment.\n\n\nYou need to configure a Power Automate flow to update account records by using the response from the Web API.\n\nWhich three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.\n\n//IMG//",

The company subsidizes home improvements for domestic customers, to improve energy efficiency and to meet environmental commitments. The company also distributes and generates electricity for domestic and commercial customers. The company has 2,000 employees in multiple offices and in work-from-home locations.\n\nCity Power & Light uses a team of schedulers, assessors, field engineers, and customer support agents for home improvements in a program named Get Energy Fit.\n\n\nCurrent Environment -\n\n\nGet Energy Fit Program -\n\nCity Power & Light uses the following to manage the Get Energy Fit program:\n\n• The company uses a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet named Planning Hub on Microsoft SharePoint Online to store information about customer appointments, customer details, and customer eligibility in the program.\n• The company records sensitive customer information that includes the document identification numbers and the customer's financial information.\n• The company uses an assessor to verify customer eligibility in the program and to perform a suitability assessment. The assessor completes the suitability assessment by using a paper and clipboard at the customer property and enters the data to the Planning Hub after the assessment is completed. The assessor also uploads photographs to an on-premises document library. The assessor completes the eligibility assessment by using an application written in React.\n• Schedulers use Microsoft Outlook to schedule engineers and assessors for home improvement appointments. About 200 appointments are scheduled daily.\n• Employees for the company submit funding claims on behalf of the customer by uploading evidence and compliance checks information to an application named the Claim Submission Portal.\n\n\nTechnical Environment -\n\n• Schedulers use Windows 11 desktop and laptop computers with the latest version of Microsoft Edge.\n• Assessors use iOS and Android tablet devices.\n• The Claim Submission Portal uses REST-based APIs for all operations and a dedicated testing environment. Authentication to the API is provided by using the following example header key and value pair: o Authentication: 2C8D41431415E429C7FC7A74D8315\n• The company uses Microsoft Azure for hosting multiple applications.\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\nOverview -\n\nCity Power & Light plans to implement Microsoft Power Platform to improve the customer experience and increase delivery for the Get Energy Fit program.\n\n\nBusiness Requirements -\n\n• Only team leaders and senior managers should have access to read personally identifiable information (PII).\n• All development changes must be tested in a separate environment.\n• The company requires out-of-the-box solutions, when possible.\n• Sensitive credentials, such as user passwords and API secrets, must be stored securely.\n• The Claim Submission Portal must allow citizen developers to create automated solutions.\n• Customer and appointment information must be accessible to all applications.\n\n\nPlanning Hub Application -\n\nThe company is planning to replace the Planning Hub spreadsheet with a new application.
